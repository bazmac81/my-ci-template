#Welome to My CI Template

This is my first project file and repository. In it I have:

- Created a repository using the CI template for GitPod
- Created a simple website detailing the streams covered in the Full Stack Development Course
- Utilised the CLI to add, commit, and push files to GitHub

From completing this project I have learned and understood:
- How to manage version control in my files
- How to write clear, concise commits for another user to understand my process

This project has been completed using:

- HTML
- GitPod
- GitHub

If you have any questions please let me know.
